# ObsLog
Logging System for ARCC Telescope Observations

This is an Observation Logging tool for ARCC Team Leaders to submit Observation Logs. This project is intended to facilitate
giving proper credit where due for ARCC Members. It will also include ways to obtain sky coverage plots and figures to quantify 
the effect of the ARCC research group on the scientific community.
